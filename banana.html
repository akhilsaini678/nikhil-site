<h4>Each banana has only about <u style="color:green">105 calories</u>  and consists almost exclusively of water and carbs.<br>
 Bananas hold very little protein and almost no fat.<p>

The carbs in green, unripe bananas consist mostly of starch and resistant starch, but as the <br>

<h2>The Evidence-basesd benefits of <u style="color:orange">bananas</u> in breif :</h2>
<div>
	<details>
		<summary>Bananas Contain Nutrients That Moderate Blood Sugar Levels</summary>
		Bananas are rich in pectin, a type of fiber that gives the flesh its spongy structural form. <br>
		Unripe bananas contain resistant starch, which acts like soluble fiber and escapes digestion. <br>
		Both pectin and resistant starch may moderate blood sugar levels after meals and reduce appetite by slowing the emptying of your stomach. <br>
		Furthermore, bananas also rank low to medium on the glycemic index (GI), which is a measure — from 0–100 — of how quickly foods increase blood sugar levels. <br>
		The GI value of unripe bananas is about 30, while ripe bananas rank at about 60. The average value of all bananas is 51 . <br>
		This means that bananas should not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in healthy individuals. <br>
		However, this may not apply to people with type 2 diabetes, who should probably avoid eating a lot of well-ripened bananas — and monitor their blood sugar carefully if they do. <br>

		<summary>Bananas May Improve Digestive Health.</summary>
		Dietary fiber has been linked to many health benefits, including improved digestion.<br>
		A medium-sized banana has about 3 grams of fiber, making bananas a fairly good fiber source.<br>
		Bananas contain two main types of fiber:<br>
		Pectin: Decreases as the banana ripens.<br>
		Resistant starch: Found<br>
		in unripe bananas.<br>
		Resistant starch escapes digestion and ends up in your large intestine, where it becomes food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut <br>
		Additionally, some test-tube studies propose that pectin may help protect against colon cancer. <br>

		<summary>Bananas May Aid Weight Loss and gain both.</summary>
		No study has directly tested the effects of bananas on weight loss. However, bananas do have several attributes that should make them a weight-loss-friendly-food.<br>
		For starters, bananas have relatively few calories. An average banana has just over 100 calories — yet it is also very nutritious and filling.<br>
		Eating more fiber from vegetables and fruits like bananas has repeatedly been linked to lower body weight and weight loss.<br>
		Furthermore, unripe bananas are packed with resistant starch, so they tend to be very filling and may reduce your appetite . <br>
		A medium-sized banana has about 100-120calories which provides to our body weight gain. <br>

		<summary>Bananas May Support Heart Health.</summary>
		Potassium is a mineral that is essential for heart health — especially blood pressure control.<br>
		Despite its importance, few people get enough potassium in their diet .<br>
		Bananas are a great dietary source of potassium. One medium-sized banana (118 grams) contains 9% of the RDI.<br>
		A potassium-rich diet can help lower blood pressure, and people who eat plenty of potassium have up to a 27% lower risk of heart disease .<br>
		Furthermore, bananas contain a decent amount of magnesium, which is also important for heart health .<br>

		<summary>Bananas Contain Powerful Antioxidants</summary>
		Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of dietary antioxidants, and bananas are no exception.<br>
		They contain several types of potent antioxidants, including dopamine and catechins .<br>
		These antioxidants are linked to many health benefits, such as a reduced risk of heart disease and degenerative illnesses .<br>
		However, it is a common misunderstanding that the dopamine from bananas acts as a feel-good chemical in your brain.<br>
		In reality, dopamine from bananas does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It simply acts as a strong antioxidant instead of altering hormones or mood ).<br>

		<summary>Bananas May Help You Feel More Full</summary>
		Resistant starch is a type of indigestible carb — found in unripe bananas and other foods — which functions like soluble fiber in your body.<br>
		As a rule of thumb, you can estimate that the greener the banana, the higher its resistant starch content (31).<br>
		On the other hand, yellow, ripe bananas contain lower amounts of resistant starch and total fiber — but proportionally higher amounts of soluble fiber.<br>
		Both pectin and resistant starch offer appetite-reducing effects and increase the feeling of fullness after meals.<br>

		<summary>Unripe Bananas May Improve Insulin Sensitivity</summary>
		Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for many of the world’s most serious diseases, including type 2 diabetes.<br>
		Several studies reveal that 15–30 grams of resistant starch per day may improve insulin sensitivity by 33–50% in as few as four weeks .<br>
		Unripe bananas are a great source of resistant starch. Therefore, they may help improve insulin sensitivity.<br>
		However, the reason for these effects is not well understood, and not all studies agree on the matter .<br>
		More studies should be conducted on bananas and insulin sensitivity.<br>

		<summary>Bananas May Improve Kidney Health</summary>
		Potassium is essential for blood pressure control and healthy kidney function.<br>
		As a good dietary source of potassium, bananas may be especially beneficial for maintaining healthy kidneys.<br>
		One 13-year study in women determined that those who ate bananas 2–3 times per week were 33% less likely to develop kidney disease .<br>
		Other studies note that those who eat bananas 4–6 times a week are almost 50% less likely to develop kidney disease than those who don’t eat this fruit .<br>

		<summary>Bananas Are Easy to Add to Your Diet</summary>
		Not only are bananas incredibly healthy — they’re also one of the most convenient snack foods around.<br>
		Bananas make a great addition to yogurt, cereal and smoothies. You can even use them instead of sugar in your baking and cooking.<br>
		Furthermore, bananas rarely contain any pesticides or pollutants due to their thick protective peel.<br>
		Bananas are incredibly easy to eat and transport. They are usually well-tolerated and easily digested — they simply have to be peeled and eaten.<br>
		It doesn’t get much easier than that.<br>

		<summary>Bananas May Have Benefits for Exercise</summary>
		Bananas are often referred to as the perfect food for athletes largely due to their mineral content and easily digested carbs.<br>
		Eating bananas may help reduce exercise-related muscle cramps and soreness, which affect up to 95% of the general population.<br>
		The reason for the cramps is largely unknown, but a popular theory blames a mixture of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance .<br>
		However, research gives mixed findings about bananas and muscle cramps. While some studies find them helpful, others find no effects.<br>
		That said, bananas do provide excellent nutrition before, during and after endurance exercise.<br>
